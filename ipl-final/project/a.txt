The DLF Indian Premier League today announced the final playing squads of all its eight franchises for the much awaited Season II slated to start on April 10th 2008. A grand total of 268 cricketers will participate in Season II of the DLF Indian Premier League. With the playing squads of each of the franchises ranging between 24 to 56 players, there are a total of 188 Indians participating in the league. 

The centrally contracted India international players aside, Season II will see a host of additional Indian cricketers that have been drafted into the teams by the respective franchises from their individual catchment areas, the talent available from the Under – 19 and Under – 22 squads and Ranji Trophy players as per the statutory guidelines drawn up by the DLF IPL. Not to forget the 80 international cricketers that will represent the finest international talent from teams like the West Indies, Australia, Bangladesh, South Africa, Sri lanka, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and England.

Lalit Modi, Chairman & Commissioner DLF IPL said, “The finalisation of the playing squads by each of the eight franchises is truly a major milestone for Season II of the Indian Premier League. All the franchisees seem to have struck fine balance with a delectable mix of experience and the exuberance of youth, all of which will make for some amazing cricketing prospects ahead. But I am particularly pleased by the fact that all the franchisees have invested in grooming young Indian talent, who will undoubtedly benefit immensely from their experiences with the international players and their interactions with the India Seniors. I am certain now, more than ever that the cricket loving millions across the world will be treated to some truly amazing cricket in Season II, when the first ball is bowled in the inaugural game on April 10th at Mumbai.”
