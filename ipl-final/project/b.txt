The England and Wales Cricket Board has today been thanked by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for their readiness to be a venue for the Indian Premier League.
 
However both the ECB and BCCI recognised that there were logistical issues, including climate and permanent floodlights, which made South Africa a more practical choice in the timescale available.
 
David Collier, the ECB chief executive, said: 'We wish the IPL every success in South Africa and are grateful for the letter of thanks we have received from the BCCI for the assistance and support we offered to IPL. However we all recognised the difficulties and logistical issues involved in areas such as security when the G20 is meeting in the UK next week and the climatic challenges. ECB is pleased that a number of nations offered to supoport the IPL and we do believe the event will be a great success in South Africa'.
 
Mr. N. Srinivasan, the Honorary Secretary of the BCCI commented: 'BCCI and IPL are grateful to the ECB who responded so promptly to our call for assistance in staging the 2009 IPL event. The close working relationship we have developed with the ECB made this possible but the climatic conditions in England during mid April and the absence of permanent floodlights at many of the venues made South Africa the better option for a tournament at this time of the year.'
