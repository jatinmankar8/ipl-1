Kolkata: Kolkata Knight Riders’ Director of Operations John Buchanan and its icon player Sourav Ganguly announced on Tuesday that the team would not have a “fixed captain” for the second edition of the event, due to be played in South Africa next month. 

They said the captain fo each game would be picked from among a pool of four leaders including New Zealand wicket-keeeper batsman Brendon McCullum, West Indies skipper Chris Gayle and Sourav Ganguly. The think tank has not named the fourth player in the pool yet..

The interesting concept mirrors the concept of captaincy-rotation seen in soccer. Buchanan is known for his out-of -the-box thinking and has given the cricketing world another new concept to think about. 

When Buchanan started the press briefing by saying he was keen to change the approach to captaincy and leadership in cricket, few had any clue about what was to follow. With four captains at the helm of affairs, he will have different views to  draw from and different strategies will be adopted by the team when it encounters a difficult situation.
